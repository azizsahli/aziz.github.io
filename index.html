<h1>The Polar Bear</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a carnivorous bear whose nati
ve range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arcti
c Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is a larg
e bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear (Ursu
s arctos middendorffi).[3] A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 
kg (772–1,543 lb),[4] while a sow (adult female) is about half that si
ze. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear,[5] it has evol
ved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristi
cs adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open 
ater, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet.</p>
